# 🧪 Projects and Case Studies
##  1. Statistical Modeling & Health Analytics

### Cholera Surveillance & Forecasting (Kenya)
Conducted time series analysis on cholera case data across Kenyan counties, integrating environmental and demographic variables. Built an interactive dashboard and a seasonal ARIMA model in R to forecast future outbreaks, improving preparedness and reducing regional response time by up to 30%.

### HIV/AIDS Transmission Risk Modeling
Investigated HIV/AIDS transmission patterns using national health datasets. Employed logistic regression and chi-square tests to analyze the relationship between socio-demographic factors (e.g., education levels, marital status) and infection risk, revealing statistically significant disparities across counties. Results informed targeted community-based interventions.

### Quality of Pediatric Clinical Assessment – Nyeri, Kenya
This study aimed to assess the quality of clinical assessment provided to sick children aged 2–59 months in primary health facilities in Nyeri County. It examined both the clinical care delivered and caregiver satisfaction, while exploring the relationship between the two. Using structured facility assessments and caregiver interviews, the study applied descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, and logistic regression to evaluate the quality of care and identify key factors influencing caregiver perceptions. The insights generated informed recommendations for enhancing pediatric service delivery and strengthening caregiver engagement in rural healthcare settings.

## 2. Machine Learning Projects

### Malaria Detection Using CNNs
Built a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify infected vs. uninfected blood cells from microscope images. Applied image augmentation and performance tuning to achieve high accuracy for early disease diagnosis.

### Cotton Disease Detection (PyTorch)
Developed a classification model using PyTorch to detect plant diseases from leaf images. Applied transfer learning with ResNet, improving accuracy by over 20% after optimizing preprocessing and hyperparameters.

### Content-Based Recommendation System
Built a recommendation engine using Python to suggest products based on user behavior and preferences. Integrated cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectorization to personalize suggestions for e-commerce users.

## 📊 3. Data Analysis & Dashboarding

### NGO Reporting System & Power BI Dashboard
Designed and implemented a comprehensive PostgreSQL database to centralize program monitoring data for a local NGO. Built end-to-end ETL pipelines and connected the database to Power BI to automate reporting. Developed a dynamic dashboard to track KPIs, visualize program reach, and generate donor-ready impact reports — significantly improving reporting efficiency and transparency.

### Customer Churn Analysis (Telco)
Analyzed telecom customer behavior using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn to identify churn drivers. Trained and tested models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) achieving 85% accuracy. Developed a real-time Power BI dashboard to monitor churn trends, enabling targeted customer retention strategies that reduced churn by 15%.

### Sales Performance Dashboard
Built a dynamic sales dashboard in Power BI that tracked revenue, conversion rates, and sales rep performance across regions. Integrated data from Excel, SQL, and CRM systems. Delivered actionable insights that led to a 15% increase in regional sales performance within 3 months.
